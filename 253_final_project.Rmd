# Introduction to the data and research question

This dataset is a compilation of all the win/loss records and other important statistics from all Division One men's basketball programs between 2016 and 2019 for the Power Five conferences (five biggest D1 conferences). It includes descriptive statistics like conference name and number of wins, in addition to statistics that evaluate play, such as offensive efficiency, 3 point percentage, free throws, and other common basketball metrics.

As this dataset includes all of the many of the most popular basketball metrics, we are interested in building a model that most effectively predicts wins, our response variable. 

## Our research question 

What type of machine learning model is the best type to predict wins in men's college basketball using popular metrics that evaluate performance? 

# Response variable: Wins 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cbb%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=W)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  labs(x= "Distribution of Wins")
```

This illustrates that most teams have between 10 and 20 wins and that the response variable is reasonably distributed. This is promising for model making!

## Explanatory Plots

Here we are going to include other explanatory plots and descriptions. 

# The Model Building Process

Initially, we picked out a couple of predictors that we thought were most important in order to predict wins informed by our exploratory analysis, including 3 point percentage, 2 point percentage, free throw rate alllowed, turnovers, and BARTHAG (the team's likelihood of beating an "average" division one team). 

However, the models we made including all of the variables in the dataset performed better, so our final models incorporate all of the performance based statistics in the dataset.
